0,GERD,"{""GERD"": 0.6, ""Boerhaave"": 0.2, ""Possible NSTEMI / STEMI"": 0.1, ""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.1}","The patient's symptoms are most consistent with GERD, given the burning pain in the hypochondrium radiating to the upper chest, the burning sensation starting in the stomach and moving to the throat, and symptoms worsening when lying down. The presence of a hiatal hernia and excessive alcohol consumption further supports GERD. Boerhaave syndrome is considered due to the severe pain and history of black stools, suggesting possible esophageal rupture, though less likely without vomiting. Possible NSTEMI/STEMI is considered due to the chest pain, but the burning quality and other symptoms make it less likely. Pulmonary embolism is considered due to chest pain and cough, but the absence of travel history or other risk factors makes it less probable."
1,Acute COPD exacerbation / infection,"{""Acute COPD exacerbation / infection"": 0.4, ""Bronchitis"": 0.25, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.2, ""Pneumonia"": 0.15}","The patient is a 2-year-old male presenting with burning pharyngeal pain, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, cough, and wheezing. The presence of COPD in such a young patient is unusual, suggesting a possible acute exacerbation or misreporting. However, given the symptoms, an acute COPD exacerbation or infection is considered due to the combination of respiratory distress, wheezing, and cough. Bronchitis is also likely due to the cough and pharyngeal pain, which are common in viral infections affecting the bronchi. Viral pharyngitis is considered due to the burning throat pain and nasal congestion, typical of upper respiratory tract infections. Pneumonia is included due to the significant respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath and wheezing, although less likely than the other conditions. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptomatology and age of the patient."
2,Acute dystonic reactions,"{""Acute dystonic reactions"": 0.7, ""Larygospasm"": 0.15, ""Myasthenia gravis"": 0.15}","The patient's symptoms and recent history strongly suggest an acute dystonic reaction, which is a known side effect of antipsychotic medications. The symptoms of muscle spasms, difficulty keeping the tongue in the mouth, and trouble with eyelid movement are classic signs of dystonia. The sensation of suffocation could be related to laryngospasm, which can occur in dystonic reactions. Myasthenia gravis is considered due to the difficulty with eyelid movement and muscle weakness, but the acute onset following antipsychotic use makes dystonia more likely. Laryngospasm is considered due to the sensation of suffocation, but it is less likely than dystonia given the medication history."
3,Acute laryngitis,"{""Acute laryngitis"": 0.35, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.3, ""Bronchitis"": 0.15, ""Influenza"": 0.1, ""Pneumonia"": 0.1}","The patient is a 64-year-old male with symptoms including burning pharyngeal pain, fever, cough, and hoarseness of voice. These symptoms are most consistent with acute laryngitis, which is characterized by hoarseness, throat pain, and often follows a viral upper respiratory infection. Viral pharyngitis is also a strong possibility given the sore throat and fever, common in viral infections. Bronchitis is considered due to the cough and fever, although the absence of significant lower respiratory symptoms makes it less likely. Influenza is possible given the fever and cough, but the lack of systemic symptoms like myalgia or fatigue makes it less likely. Pneumonia is considered due to the fever and cough, but the absence of significant respiratory distress or productive cough makes it less probable. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the presented symptoms and typical clinical presentations."
4,Influenza,"{""Influenza"": 0.35, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.25, ""Pneumonia"": 0.2, ""Acute rhinosinusitis"": 0.1, ""Bronchitis"": 0.1}","The patient is a 70-year-old female presenting with fever, sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, nasal congestion, and cough. These symptoms are consistent with a viral respiratory infection. Influenza is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of fever, muscle pain, and respiratory symptoms, especially considering recent contact with someone with similar symptoms. Viral pharyngitis is also a strong possibility due to the sore throat and fever. Pneumonia is considered due to the cough and fever, though the absence of travel history and specific lung findings makes it less likely than influenza. Acute rhinosinusitis is possible due to nasal congestion and facial pain, but the lack of sinus-specific symptoms makes it less likely. Bronchitis is considered due to the cough and fever, but the presence of muscle pain and sore throat makes viral causes more probable."
5,Influenza,"{""Influenza"": 0.35, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.25, ""Acute rhinosinusitis"": 0.15, ""Bronchitis"": 0.15, ""Pneumonia"": 0.1}","The patient's symptoms include fever, sore throat, cough, and diffuse muscle pain, which are strongly indicative of Influenza, hence the highest probability of 0.35. Viral pharyngitis is also a possibility given the sore throat and fever, with a probability of 0.25. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to the localized temple pain and potential sinus involvement, assigned a probability of 0.15. Bronchitis is possible due to the productive cough and smoking history, also at 0.15. Pneumonia is less likely but possible given the fever and productive cough, assigned a probability of 0.10."
6,Inguinal hernia,"{""Inguinal hernia"": 0.5, ""Whooping cough"": 0.3, ""Localized edema"": 0.2}","The patient is a 52-year-old male presenting with left testicular pain, a pale rash in the left iliac fossa, and intense coughing fits. The pain is described as heavy but not intense, and it does not radiate. The rash is swollen and larger than 1cm, but there is no itching. The symptoms worsen with coughing or physical exertion. Given these symptoms, an inguinal hernia is the most plausible diagnosis, as it can present with testicular pain and a bulge or rash in the iliac region, especially if exacerbated by coughing or straining. The presence of intense coughing fits suggests whooping cough as a possible concurrent condition, particularly since the patient reports no recent travel, which makes other infectious causes less likely. Localized edema could explain the swelling and rash in the iliac fossa. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of these conditions based on the symptomatology, with inguinal hernia being the most likely due to the specific location and nature of the pain and rash."
7,Spontaneous pneumothorax,"{""Spontaneous pneumothorax"": 0.35, ""Acute COPD exacerbation / infection"": 0.25, ""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.15, ""Unstable angina"": 0.1, ""Pneumonia"": 0.1, ""Possible NSTEMI / STEMI"": 0.05}","The patient's symptoms and history strongly suggest a respiratory issue, particularly given the history of spontaneous pneumothorax and COPD. The presence of severe chest pain at rest, shortness of breath, and a history of pneumothorax in the family make 'Spontaneous pneumothorax' the most likely diagnosis, hence the highest probability. 'Acute COPD exacerbation / infection' is also highly probable due to the patient's age, history of COPD, and respiratory symptoms. 'Pulmonary embolism' is considered due to the acute onset of symptoms and chest pain, although the lack of travel history reduces its likelihood. 'Unstable angina' is considered due to the chest pain at rest and the patient's advanced age, which increases cardiovascular risk. 'Pneumonia' is possible given the respiratory symptoms, but less likely without fever or productive cough. 'Possible NSTEMI / STEMI' is considered due to the severe chest pain, but the lack of radiating pain and other typical cardiac symptoms makes it less likely."
8,Acute COPD exacerbation / infection,"{""Acute COPD exacerbation / infection"": 0.35, ""Bronchitis"": 0.25, ""Pneumonia"": 0.2, ""Influenza"": 0.1, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.1}","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with symptoms including burning pain in the posterior chest wall, productive cough, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and wheezing. These symptoms are highly suggestive of a respiratory infection or exacerbation. Acute COPD exacerbation is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of COPD and the presence of wheezing and increased sputum production, which are common in COPD exacerbations. Bronchitis is also a plausible diagnosis due to the cough and fever, and it often coexists with COPD exacerbations. Pneumonia is considered due to the fever and productive cough, although the absence of severe localized chest pain or significant respiratory distress makes it slightly less likely. Influenza is possible given the fever, sore throat, and cough, but the presence of wheezing and COPD history makes it less likely than the other conditions. Viral pharyngitis is considered due to the sore throat and fever, but it is less likely to cause wheezing and productive cough, thus assigned a lower probability."
9,GERD,"{""GERD"": 0.35, ""Boerhaave"": 0.25, ""Possible NSTEMI / STEMI"": 0.2, ""Peptic Ulcer Disease"": 0.1, ""Unstable angina"": 0.1}","The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of GERD, given the burning sensation starting in the stomach and moving up to the throat, worsened by lying down and alleviated by sitting up, and the presence of a hiatal hernia. The epigastric pain radiating to the chest, high intensity, and black stools suggest possible complications such as Boerhaave syndrome or peptic ulcer disease with bleeding. The severe pain and radiation to the chest also raise the suspicion of cardiac issues, such as a possible NSTEMI/STEMI or unstable angina, especially given the patient's age and smoking history. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of GERD being the primary issue, with consideration for serious complications or concurrent conditions."
10,Acute COPD exacerbation / infection,"{""Acute COPD exacerbation / infection"": 0.5, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.2, ""Bronchitis"": 0.15, ""GERD"": 0.1, ""Pneumonia"": 0.05}","The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of COPD, presenting with burning chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nasal congestion, and wheezing. The symptoms are more prominent at night. The most likely diagnosis is an acute COPD exacerbation, given the patient's history of COPD, smoking, and the presence of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and cough. This accounts for the highest probability of 0.50. Bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation is also considered due to the wheezing and shortness of breath, with a probability of 0.20. Bronchitis is a possibility given the cough and nasal congestion, with a probability of 0.15. GERD is considered due to the burning chest pain, albeit less likely, with a probability of 0.10. Pneumonia is less likely due to the absence of fever and more severe symptoms, but still possible given the respiratory symptoms, with a probability of 0.05."
11,Acute COPD exacerbation / infection,"{""Acute COPD exacerbation / infection"": 0.5, ""Bronchitis"": 0.2, ""Pneumonia"": 0.15, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.1, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.05}","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with burning pain in the posterior chest wall, shortness of breath, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, and wheezing. The most likely diagnosis is an acute COPD exacerbation, given the history of COPD and the presence of respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. This accounts for the highest probability of 0.50. Bronchitis is considered due to the cough and nasal congestion, with a probability of 0.20. Pneumonia is possible given the respiratory symptoms and age, though the absence of fever and the low intensity of pain make it less likely, thus a probability of 0.15. Viral pharyngitis is considered due to the sore throat and nasal congestion, with a probability of 0.10. Finally, bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation is considered due to the wheezing, albeit less likely than COPD exacerbation, with a probability of 0.05."
12,Viral pharyngitis,"{""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.3, ""Influenza"": 0.25, ""Bronchitis"": 0.2, ""Pneumonia"": 0.15, ""Acute rhinosinusitis"": 0.1}","The patient presents with symptoms including a sore throat, cough, and increased sweating, along with a heavy pain in the occiput. The recent contact with someone with similar symptoms and living with multiple people suggests a contagious respiratory condition. Viral pharyngitis is likely given the sore throat and cough, common in viral infections, and is assigned the highest probability. Influenza is also considered due to the systemic symptoms like sweating and the potential for respiratory involvement, hence a high probability. Bronchitis is possible due to the cough and environmental exposure to secondhand smoke, which can exacerbate respiratory conditions. Pneumonia is considered due to the cough and potential for pain, but the lack of travel and specific localization of pain makes it less likely. Acute rhinosinusitis is included due to the sore throat and potential sinus involvement, but with a lower probability given the lack of nasal symptoms."
13,Anemia,"{""Anemia"": 0.5, ""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.2, ""Chronic rhinosinusitis"": 0.1, ""Tuberculosis"": 0.1, ""Pulmonary neoplasm"": 0.1}","The patient's symptoms and history strongly suggest anemia, which is supported by her pale skin, history of anemia, poor diet, and chronic kidney failure. These factors contribute to a high probability (0.50) of anemia. The shortness of breath, dizziness, and fatigue could also indicate a pulmonary embolism, especially given the recent travel to North Africa, which raises the risk of deep vein thrombosis and subsequent embolism, thus a probability of 0.20. Chronic rhinosinusitis is considered due to the presence of temple pain, although it is less likely given the other symptoms, so it is assigned a probability of 0.10. Tuberculosis is considered due to travel history and systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss (underweight), with a probability of 0.10. Finally, pulmonary neoplasm is considered due to the chronic symptoms and age of the patient, with a probability of 0.10."
14,Acute laryngitis,"{""Acute laryngitis"": 0.35, ""Epiglottitis"": 0.3, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.15, ""Anaphylaxis"": 0.1, ""Bronchitis"": 0.1}","The patient's primary symptom is a high-pitched sound when breathing in, which suggests stridor. This is often associated with upper airway obstruction. Acute laryngitis is a common cause of stridor, especially in adults, due to inflammation of the larynx, and is supported by the patient's exposure to secondhand smoke, which can irritate the airway. Epiglottitis, although less common in adults, can also present with stridor and is a serious condition that requires consideration. Bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation could cause wheezing, which might be perceived as a high-pitched sound, especially if the patient has underlying asthma or reactive airway disease. Anaphylaxis is considered due to the potential for airway swelling, although the absence of other symptoms like rash or hypotension makes it less likely. Bronchitis is included as it can cause wheezing and is common in smokers or those exposed to smoke. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptomatology and risk factors presented."
15,Influenza,"{""Influenza"": 0.35, ""Pneumonia"": 0.25, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.15, ""Acute rhinosinusitis"": 0.15, ""Bronchitis"": 0.1}","The patient is a 68-year-old male presenting with symptoms including a heavy, intense headache located in the right temple, productive cough, sore throat, diffuse muscle pain, and nasal congestion. The recent contact with others having similar symptoms and living with multiple people suggests a contagious respiratory infection. Influenza is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of respiratory symptoms, muscle pain, and the patient's age, which increases susceptibility. Pneumonia is considered due to the productive cough and potential for serious respiratory infections in older adults. Viral pharyngitis is possible due to the sore throat and nasal congestion. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to nasal congestion and facial pain, which could be perceived as a headache. Bronchitis is included due to the cough and sputum production. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptom presentation and epidemiological context."
16,Viral pharyngitis,"{""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.3, ""Influenza"": 0.25, ""URTI"": 0.2, ""Acute rhinosinusitis"": 0.15, ""Bronchitis"": 0.1}","The patient is a 2-year-old female presenting with symptoms including a sore throat, cough with sputum, nasal congestion, and diffuse muscle pain. These symptoms are consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection. The contact with a person with similar symptoms suggests a contagious viral illness. Viral pharyngitis is likely due to the sore throat and age of the patient, accounting for 30% probability. Influenza is considered due to the diffuse muscle pain and respiratory symptoms, with a 25% probability. An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is also possible given the nasal congestion and cough, assigned a 20% probability. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to nasal congestion and facial pain, with a 15% probability. Bronchitis is less likely but possible due to the productive cough, assigned a 10% probability. Other conditions such as acute COPD exacerbation or pneumonia are less likely given the patient's age and lack of severe respiratory distress."
17,Chronic rhinosinusitis,"{""Chronic rhinosinusitis"": 0.3, ""Allergic sinusitis"": 0.25, ""Cluster headache"": 0.2, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.15, ""GERD"": 0.1}","The patient's symptoms and history suggest a combination of respiratory and sinus issues. Chronic rhinosinusitis is highly probable given the nasal congestion, history of nasal polyps, deviated septum, and loss of smell. Allergic sinusitis is also likely due to the patient's increased likelihood of allergies and nasal symptoms. The sharp pain in the right eye radiating to the left temple is characteristic of a cluster headache. Bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation is considered due to the history of asthma and cough. GERD is included because of the patient's history and its potential to exacerbate respiratory symptoms. These probabilities reflect the overlap and interaction of these conditions."
18,Pneumonia,"{""Pneumonia"": 0.6, ""Bronchiolitis"": 0.2, ""Bronchitis"": 0.1, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.1}","The patient is a 4-year-old female presenting with burning posterior chest wall pain, shortness of breath, productive cough, fever, and wheezing. These symptoms are highly suggestive of a respiratory infection. Pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of fever, productive cough, and localized chest pain, which aligns with the typical presentation of pneumonia in children. Bronchiolitis is considered due to the patient's age and wheezing, which is common in viral lower respiratory tract infections in young children. Bronchitis is also a possibility given the cough and fever, but the presence of chest pain and wheezing makes it less likely than pneumonia. Bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation is considered due to the wheezing, but the presence of fever and productive cough makes an infectious cause more probable. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptomatology and typical presentations in pediatric patients."
19,Panic attack,"{""Panic attack"": 0.35, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.2, ""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.15, ""Atrial fibrillation"": 0.1, ""Myocarditis"": 0.1, ""Acute COPD exacerbation / infection"": 0.1}","The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical picture with both respiratory and psychological components. The presence of anxiety, feeling of choking, palpitations, and a sense of impending doom strongly suggest a panic attack, which is supported by the patient's history of depression and anxiety. This is assigned the highest probability. Bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation is considered due to the patient's history of asthma and symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing. Pulmonary embolism is a possibility given the sudden onset of severe pain, shortness of breath, and risk factors such as age and possibly sedentary lifestyle due to depression. Atrial fibrillation is considered due to palpitations and dizziness, which can be exacerbated by anxiety or panic attacks. Myocarditis is included due to the combination of respiratory symptoms and palpitations, which can mimic cardiac issues. Lastly, acute COPD exacerbation is considered due to the patient's history of asthma and respiratory symptoms, although less likely than the other conditions. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptomatology and clinical history."
20,Pulmonary embolism,"{""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.6, ""Pneumonia"": 0.15, ""Spontaneous pneumothorax"": 0.1, ""Boerhaave"": 0.1, ""Tuberculosis"": 0.05}","The patient's symptoms and history strongly suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE) as the most likely diagnosis. The presence of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), sharp chest pain that radiates, shortness of breath, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), recent immobility, and recent surgery are classic risk factors and symptoms for PE, justifying a high probability of 0.60. Pneumonia is considered due to the respiratory symptoms and chest pain, but the lack of fever and productive cough makes it less likely, thus a probability of 0.15. Spontaneous pneumothorax is possible given the sudden onset of sharp chest pain and difficulty breathing, but the bilateral nature of the pain and other risk factors make it less likely, assigned a probability of 0.10. Boerhaave syndrome is considered due to the severe chest pain and recent surgery, but the absence of vomiting or esophageal rupture history makes it less likely, hence a probability of 0.10.

She also has a history of spontaneous pneumothorax. The presence of chest pain at rest and a history of spontaneous pneumothorax strongly suggests the possibility of a recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, hence the highest probability is assigned to this condition. Unstable angina is considered due to the chest pain at rest and the patient's age and smoking history, which are risk factors for coronary artery disease. Pulmonary embolism is considered due to the acute onset of severe chest pain and the patient's smoking history, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Possible NSTEMI/STEMI is considered due to the severe chest pain and risk factors, although the lack of radiation and other typical symptoms make it less likely. Pulmonary neoplasm is considered due to the patient's smoking history and age, which are risk factors for lung cancer, and the localized nature of the pain, although the acute presentation is less typical for a neoplasm."

These symptoms are suggestive of a viral infection. Influenza is highly probable given the fever, cough, sore throat, and systemic symptoms like fatigue and muscle pain. Viral pharyngitis is also considered due to the sore throat and fever. Pneumonia is possible given the cough and fever, though less likely without respiratory distress. SLE is considered due to the rash and systemic symptoms, though less common in this age group. Initial HIV infection is considered due to the immunosuppressed status and systemic symptoms, though less likely in a child without known risk factors. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptomatology and typical presentations."

The presence of asthma and the symptom of shortness of breath also raise the possibility of a bronchospasm or acute asthma exacerbation. Atrial fibrillation is considered due to the palpitations and the patient's age. The chest pain, although mild, and the shortness of breath could indicate a cardiac event such as NSTEMI/STEMI, especially given the patient's age and sex. Finally, pulmonary embolism is considered due to the combination of shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizziness, although the lack of recent travel reduces its likelihood. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of each condition based on the symptomatology and clinical context."

The use of stimulant drugs can exacerbate this condition, supporting this diagnosis. The sudden feeling of suffocation could be due to Larygospasm, a brief spasm of the vocal cords, which can also be triggered by stimulants. Acute dystonic reactions, which can occur with drug use, could explain the jaw pain and difficulty opening the mouth. Panic attacks can cause a sensation of suffocation and are considered due to the stimulant use, but the presence of more specific neuromuscular symptoms makes this less likely. Myasthenia gravis is given the highest probability due to the specific symptom of eyelid weakness, which is not explained by the other conditions."
26,Acute otitis media,"{""Acute otitis media"": 0.6, ""Bronchiolitis"": 0.15, ""Pneumonia"": 0.1, ""Viral pharyngitis"": 0.1, ""URTI"": 0.05}","The patient is a 1-year-old male with sharp, intense left ear pain, fever, irritability, and a cough.

The presence of active cancer and recent surgery further increases the risk of PE, making it the most likely diagnosis with a probability of 0.35. Pulmonary neoplasm is also a significant consideration due to the active cancer and hemoptysis, warranting a probability of 0.30. Pneumonia is possible given the respiratory symptoms and could explain the cough and chest pain, assigned a probability of 0.15. Spontaneous pneumothorax is considered due to the sudden onset of sharp chest pain and shortness of breath, though less likely, with a probability of 0.10.

He also has a cough with intense coughing fits and a history of excessive alcohol use. Given the metastatic cancer, 'Pulmonary neoplasm' is highly probable due to the possibility of metastasis to the lungs causing pain and cough. 'Spontaneous rib fracture' is considered due to osteoporosis and violent coughing fits, which can lead to rib fractures. 'Pneumonia' is possible given the cough and chest pain, although less likely without fever or recent travel. 'Pulmonary embolism' is considered due to the sudden onset of chest pain and the patient's cancer history, which increases thromboembolic risk. 'Boerhaave syndrome' is less likely but considered due to violent pain and alcohol use, which could predispose to esophageal rupture."

She has a history of excessive alcohol use and is being treated for osteoporosis. The sharp, localized pain and history of osteoporosis suggest a possible spontaneous rib fracture, especially given the high pain intensity and exacerbation with movement and breathing. Pneumonia is considered due to the intense coughing fits and shortness of breath, which are common symptoms. Pulmonary embolism is a possibility due to the sudden onset of sharp chest pain and significant shortness of breath, although the absence of recent travel reduces its likelihood. Bronchitis is considered due to the coughing fits and shortness of breath, but the sharp pain is less typical. Spontaneous pneumothorax is possible given the sudden sharp pain and shortness of breath, but less likely without a history of lung disease or trauma."

The patient has a history of anemia, poor diet, fatigue, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, all of which are consistent with anemia. The presence of black stools and blood in the stool could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, a common cause of anemia, especially in the context of anticoagulant use. Chronic kidney failure can also contribute to anemia. Therefore, anemia is assigned the highest probability of 0.60. Chronic rhinosinusitis is considered due to the potential for sinus-related symptoms, although less likely, it accounts for some of the fatigue and malaise, assigned a probability of 0.10. Pulmonary embolism is considered due to the shortness of breath and fatigue, especially given the anticoagulant use, assigned a probability of 0.10. Myocarditis is considered due to the fatigue and potential for cardiac involvement, assigned a probability of 0.10.

These symptoms are highly suggestive of a viral infection. Influenza is the most likely diagnosis given the combination of sore throat, muscle pain, and nasal congestion, and the fact that the patient has been in contact with someone with similar symptoms, which is common in flu transmission. Viral pharyngitis is also considered due to the sore throat and nasal symptoms. URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) is a broad category that fits the symptom profile well, especially with the sore throat and nasal congestion. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to the nasal congestion and potential sinus involvement. Bronchitis is included due to the possibility of a cough developing from the current symptoms, especially considering the patient's smoking history, which can predispose to bronchial irritation. The probabilities reflect the likelihood of these conditions based on the symptom presentation and epidemiological factors."

He also reports a burning sensation starting in the stomach and moving up to the throat, consistent with GERD, which is further supported by his hiatal hernia and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use. GERD is the most likely diagnosis given these symptoms, hence the highest probability of 0.70. Boerhaave syndrome, although rare in children, is considered due to the severe pain and history of hiatal hernia, assigned a probability of 0.15. Possible NSTEMI/STEMI is considered due to the chest pain radiating from the epigastric region, although less likely in a child, it cannot be completely ruled out, thus also assigned a probability of 0.15."

These symptoms are suggestive of a systemic infection or inflammatory process. Influenza is the most likely diagnosis given the acute onset of fever, muscle pain, and cough, which are classic symptoms of the flu. Pneumonia is also considered due to the presence of cough and fever, which could indicate a lower respiratory tract infection. HIV (initial infection) is considered due to the patient's immunosuppressed status and systemic symptoms, although less common, it can present with fever and fatigue. Myocarditis is included due to the possibility of viral infection leading to cardiac involvement, especially with the presence of fatigue and chest-related pain. Guillain-Barré syndrome is considered due to the diffuse muscle pain and potential for post-infectious neurological involvement, although it is less likely given the lack of specific neurological symptoms.

Pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis given the fever, cough, and age of the patient, which increases the risk for respiratory infections. Viral pharyngitis is considered due to the burning pain under the jaw, which could indicate throat involvement. Influenza is possible due to the fever and cough, and the recent contact with someone symptomatic. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to the location of the pain and the presence of fever and cough, although less likely than the others. Bronchitis is also a possibility given the cough and fever, but the absence of travel and the specific symptom location make it less likely.

The presence of localized swelling in the sole of the foot, history of DVT, and heart failure strongly suggest 'Localized edema' as a primary consideration, likely due to venous insufficiency or lymphatic obstruction, hence the highest probability. 'Pulmonary embolism' is considered due to the history of DVT and the potential for embolic events, which could also explain the acute nature of the symptoms. 'Heart failure' is included due to the known diagnosis and the possibility of exacerbation contributing to the symptoms. 'Myocarditis' is considered due to the sharp pain and heart involvement, and 'Pericarditis' is included as a possibility given the sharp pain and potential for cardiac involvement. Other conditions from the list are less likely given the patient's age and specific symptomatology."

The use of NSAIDs and the presence of localized edema suggest a high probability of 'Localized edema' due to fluid retention or venous insufficiency, common in patients with heart failure and liver cirrhosis. The history of DVT raises the suspicion of 'Pulmonary embolism', which can present with sharp pain, although typically more associated with chest pain, it remains a possibility due to the patient's history. 'Possible NSTEMI / STEMI' is considered due to the patient's age and cardiovascular history, although the pain is not typical for myocardial infarction.

The burning pain in the belly that radiates upwards, associated with a bitter taste, is classic for GERD, especially given the symptoms worsen after eating. The patient's obesity, alcohol use, and smoking are significant risk factors for GERD. The presence of a cough could be due to GERD but also suggests possible respiratory involvement. Given the patient's history of asthma and smoking, bronchospasm or an acute asthma exacerbation is also considered, though less likely than GERD. Bronchitis is considered due to the cough and smoking history. Pneumonia is less likely but considered due to the cough and potential for respiratory infection.

The pain is located in the right testicle, which is unusual given the patient's gender, suggesting a possible error in data entry or a miscommunication. The intense coughing fits are a key symptom that suggests a respiratory condition. Bronchitis is a common cause of cough and can cause chest discomfort, which might be perceived as abdominal bloating due to diaphragm irritation, hence it is assigned the highest probability. Whooping cough (pertussis) is also considered due to the intense coughing fits, which are characteristic of this condition, and is assigned a significant probability. Inguinal hernia is considered due to the abdominal bloating and pain, although the location of pain is atypical, it could be a misreported symptom. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to the possibility of sinus-related symptoms causing cough, but it is less likely given the lack of nasal symptoms, hence a lower probability is assigned."

Pulmonary embolism is assigned the highest probability (0.50) due to the acute presentation and risk factors. Pulmonary neoplasm is considered due to the active cancer and hemoptysis, with a probability of 0.30. Pneumonia is considered due to the cough and chest pain, although the acute and severe nature of the symptoms makes it less likely, thus a probability of 0.10. Spontaneous pneumothorax is considered due to the sudden onset of sharp chest pain and difficulty breathing, with a probability of 0.10, as it could explain the acute respiratory symptoms but is less likely given the patient's history and other risk factors."

The presence of swollen lymph nodes, fever, fatigue, weight loss, and a history of unprotected sex with multiple partners, including an HIV-positive partner, are highly indicative of acute HIV infection. The rash on the lip could be related to an opportunistic infection or a manifestation of the initial HIV infection. Cluster headache is considered due to the severe, pulsating pain localized to the left temple, although it is less common in this age group. SLE is considered due to the systemic symptoms like fatigue, fever, and rash, but the demographic and sexual history make it less likely. Influenza is a possibility given the fever, fatigue, and muscle pain, but the sexual history and lymphadenopathy make HIV more probable.

The sharp, epigastric pain radiating to the posterior chest wall, worsened by lying down and alleviated by sitting up, is classic for pericarditis, especially given the patient's history of pericarditis and recent viral infection. The presence of palpitations and shortness of breath also supports this diagnosis. Myocarditis is considered due to the recent viral infection and cardiac symptoms, but the pain characteristics are more typical of pericarditis. Pulmonary embolism is considered due to the sudden onset of symptoms and shortness of breath, but the lack of travel history and more typical pericarditis symptoms make it less likely. GERD is considered due to epigastric pain, but the radiation and positional nature of the pain are less typical.

The sharp, intense pain localized to the left eye, along with associated symptoms such as excessive tearing and nasal congestion, are classic for cluster headaches. The rapid onset of pain and the patient's alcohol use, which can be a trigger for cluster headaches, further support this diagnosis. Acute rhinosinusitis and allergic sinusitis are considered due to the nasal congestion and tearing, but the lack of other typical sinusitis symptoms (such as facial pain or pressure) and the specificity of the eye pain make these less likely.

The presence of dizziness, palpitations, and recent stimulant use could suggest atrial fibrillation or PSVT, both of which can cause palpitations and dizziness. The patient's symptoms of dizziness, palpitations, and the sudden onset of symptoms could also be indicative of a panic attack, especially given the stimulant use. Cluster headache is the most likely due to the specific nature and location of the pain, while atrial fibrillation and PSVT are considered due to the cardiovascular symptoms.

Localized edema is considered due to the swelling of the rash, but it is less likely to account for the systemic symptoms. Anaphylaxis is given the highest probability due to the severity and combination of symptoms, followed by scombroid food poisoning, which fits the context of fish consumption."
96,Localized edema,"{""Localized edema"": 0.5, ""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.3, ""Atrial fibrillation"": 0.1, ""Acute pulmonary edema"": 0.1}","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of DVT, liver cirrhosis, and recent weight gain. He presents with sharp pain in the left sole and swelling on the dorsal aspect of the left foot. The use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids, along with calcium channel blockers, suggests a complex medical history. Localized edema is the most likely diagnosis due to the specific swelling and pain location, accounting for 50% probability. Pulmonary embolism is considered due to the history of DVT and the potential for embolic events, given a 30% probability. Atrial fibrillation is possible due to the age and potential cardiovascular implications, assigned a 10% probability. Acute pulmonary edema is considered due to the potential for fluid overload from liver cirrhosis and medication effects, also at 10% probability."
97,Panic attack,"{""Panic attack"": 0.4, ""Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation"": 0.2, ""Atrial fibrillation"": 0.15, ""Myocarditis"": 0.1, ""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.1, ""Possible NSTEMI / STEMI"": 0.05}","The patient's symptoms of anxiety, increased sweating, palpitations, dizziness, and a sense of impending doom strongly suggest a panic attack, which is a common condition that can present with these symptoms, especially in someone with a history of anxiety and depression. The probability for Panic attack is the highest at 0.40. Bronchospasm / acute asthma exacerbation is considered due to the history of asthma and symptoms like palpitations and dizziness, assigning it a probability of 0.20. Atrial fibrillation is possible given the palpitations and dizziness, with a probability of 0.15. Myocarditis is considered due to the combination of palpitations, dizziness, and potential chest discomfort, with a probability of 0.10. Pulmonary embolism is a consideration due to the sudden onset of symptoms and history of immobility or travel, albeit less likely, with a probability of 0.10. Possible NSTEMI / STEMI is included due to the chest pain and palpitations, though less likely given the pain's low intensity and lack of radiation, with a probability of 0.05."
98,Pulmonary embolism,"{""Pulmonary embolism"": 0.5, ""Pulmonary neoplasm"": 0.3, ""Pneumonia"": 0.1, ""Spontaneous pneumothorax"": 0.1}","The patient presents with hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and a history of active cancer and recent immobility, all of which are highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of DVT history and recent surgery further increases the risk for PE, making it the most likely diagnosis with a probability of 0.50. Pulmonary neoplasm is also a strong consideration given the active cancer status and hemoptysis, accounting for 0.30 probability. Pneumonia is considered due to the respiratory symptoms and pleuritic pain, though less likely without fever or productive cough, assigned a probability of 0.10. Spontaneous pneumothorax is possible given the acute onset of pleuritic pain and shortness of breath, especially if there is underlying lung pathology, thus also assigned a probability of 0.10."
99,Cluster headache,"{""Cluster headache"": 0.85, ""Acute rhinosinusitis"": 0.1, ""Allergic sinusitis"": 0.05}","The patient's symptoms are highly indicative of a cluster headache, which is supported by the sharp pain localized to the right temple, high intensity (7/10), rapid onset, and associated autonomic symptoms such as excessive tearing and nasal congestion. The family history of cluster headaches further supports this diagnosis, making it the most likely condition with a probability of 0.85. Acute rhinosinusitis is considered due to nasal congestion, but the lack of other typical symptoms like facial pain or pressure makes it less likely, assigning it a probability of 0.10. Allergic sinusitis is also a possibility given the nasal symptoms, but the absence of typical allergy triggers and the presence of more specific cluster headache symptoms make it the least likely, with a probability of 0.05."
